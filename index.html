    <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
    <p>I started playing around with almost nothing in mind aesthetically. I managed to get a generic TV noise screen that I used as an intro to my through-composed animation video. I started with a moving white gradient animation, using sine function, time and frequency. Then I started adding colors and experimented with trig. functions inside the color arguments. I also wanted to experiment with step since watching the example videos in the lectures, so I used modulo of time to create a similar effect of transition. It initially looked like another heartbeat expanding to the bottom left but after adjustments on transparency and shape, it somewhat resembled stage curtains. My final experiment was switching from uvN() to uv() and with a couple tweaks, I managed to get a pretty shape that looks like a thick Smash Bros. logo. Overall, I did not have specific expectations except for creating something that looks decent and has a flow and I think I achieved that. It was a good start that gave me a lot of different ideas to test in the future.</p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>After getting the feedback, I can say that my expectations were somewhat met. Using mod() with time inside step() seems to be an impressive feature. It adds dimensions and does not look terrible. There is also another thing that apparently stood out. When I added sine and cosine functions to the color argument input, I managed to get a good wave of colors. This was something that did not grab my attention too much while I was experimenting, but I am glad it was pointed out because I went back to it later and also thought it looked pretty. I was expecting the “Smash logo” to be a highlight but it was perceived more as a star. A piece of self-criticism on my part would be that I failed to adjust the loop I was using because after watching my video a couple times, I realized I am looping from 0 to 4 (not included) and I wrote an impossible case for 4. The small additions inside the loop did not make significant impact anyway but it was an easy fix.</p>

    <small><br>My recording got interrupted so here's the first part of the video along with Vidiot documentation.</small>

      On this assignment, I focused on trying to recreate some of the pretty visuals we created with Vidiot. The main source of inspiration for me was the combination of colors we synthesized, so I tried to get similar colors in a live coding session. For this assignment, I used Glitch platform so some of the blank white parts in the video is Glitch trying to digest the changes I made. The first of half of the video is more about experimenting with multiple technical aspects like rotation, inverting, color and brightness controls. I will admit that this half is not insanely easy on the eye, but I could not find a better-looking middle ground frequency value. I also really hated how static visuals looked after some time, same with Vidiot, so I usually worked with moving shapes when I was experimenting in both analog and digital. I liked using simple shapes like squares (especially when I was using rotation) and grids but they also looked stagnant after experimenting on them for some time. The movement of the grid at the last part (after 1:30) created a pretty transition. Focusing on one cell of the grid while it's changing colors and zooming back out conveys the feeling of layers very well.

    <h3>Feedback</h3>

      Cem really liked the idea of getting a somewhat complex visual setting by playing with simple shapes and time variables. He said it was too much to take in at parts, but I already expected the fast motion to annoy people a little bit. I’m aiming to make a slower composition on the next one. I think the zoom in and out effect looked a little better than I expected because he said he liked that, too. My final criticism would be the lack of rhythm, so I think adding sound input and catering the animation around it would would elevate the experience a lot.
