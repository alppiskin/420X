            On this assignment, I focused on trying to recreate some of the pretty visuals we created with Vidiot. The main source of inspiration for me was the combination of colors we synthesized, so I tried to get similar colors in a live coding session. For this assignment, I used Glitch platform so some of the blank white parts in the video is Glitch trying to digest the changes I made. The first of half of the video is more about experimenting with multiple technical aspects like rotation, inverting, color and brightness controls. I will admit that this half is not insanely easy on the eye, but I could not find a better-looking middle ground frequency value. I also really hated how static visuals looked after some time, same with Vidiot, so I usually worked with moving shapes when I was experimenting in both analog and digital. I liked using simple shapes like squares (especially when I was using rotation) and grids but they also looked stagnant after experimenting on them for some time. The movement of the grid at the last part (after 1:30) created a pretty transition. Focusing on one cell of the grid while it's changing colors and zooming back out conveys the feeling of layers very well.

        <p>
            Cem really liked the idea of getting a somewhat complex visual setting by playing with simple shapes and time variables. He said it was too much to take in at parts, but I already expected the fast motion to annoy people a little bit. Iâ€™m aiming to make a slower composition on the next one. I think the zoom in and out effect looked a little better than I expected because he said he liked that, too. My final criticism would be the lack of rhythm, so I think adding sound input and catering the animation around it would would elevate the experience a lot.
